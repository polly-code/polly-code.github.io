## Intro

My name is [Pavel Kos](https://github.com/polly-code). I am a scientist, did PhD in physics at [Lomonosov MSU](https://phys.msu.ru/eng/), postdoc at [FMI for biomedical research](https://fmi.ch). Here is the [list of my publications](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=bIKzlw4AAAAJ&hl=en). \\
Now, I am working as a Data Scientist, obviously :) This is my technical blog. I will write mostly about projects and technologies I worked with. All the content is mine unless stated the opposite. Selection of topics is according to my personal taste. Speaking of taste, I am a coffee fan! So if you like the content, please, consider [buying me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/ilikeit).
